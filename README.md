# Scalable Web Application

## Project Overview
A multi-tier web application demonstrating cloud architecture best practices using AWS services.

## Goal
Build a production-ready web application where users can submit player profiles (name, position, stats). The application uses:
- Multiple EC2 instances for high availability
- RDS database for data storage
- Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Auto Scaling for handling demand
- S3 for static asset storage

## Current Status
In progress - Building incrementally as I learn new AWS services.
**Phase 1 (Current):** Database setup and documentation
**Phase 2:** EC2 web server deployment
**Phase 3:** Load balancing and auto scaling
**Phase 4:** Static assets in S3
**Phase 5:** Automation and monitoring

## Technologies
- AWS EC2
- AWS RDS (MySQL)
- AWS Application Load Balancer
- AWS Auto Scaling
- AWS S3
- AWS Route 53
- Python (future automation)

## Architecture
Multi-tier architecture with web layer, application layer, and database layer.
